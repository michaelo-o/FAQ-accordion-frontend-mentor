## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

### What I learned

I deepened my understanding of:

- Setting up responsive layouts using `vh` units and negative margins to overlap content over a background image.
- Writing concise and modular JavaScript to create an accordion toggle, with logic for icons (`+` and `−`) and visibility of answers.
- Managing layout using `flex` and `gap` while maintaining alignment of icons and text.
- Making the accordion accessible and mobile-friendly.

### Continued development

I’d like to continue improving on:

- Adding keyboard accessibility to the accordion functionality.
- Animating the open/close transitions for a smoother user experience.
- Implementing ARIA roles and attributes for better accessibility.
